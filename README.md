# Python 3D Rasterizer
 A Python script that reads .obj files and renders them as 3D images

Place .obj files in the same directory. You'll need to change the corresponding name in the script too.
I used blender to generate these files, I don't know if it'll read files generated by other programs.

When exporting an .obj file, use the following settings:

Forward: Z Forward
Up: Y Up
In Geometry, uncheck everything but 'triangulate faces'
